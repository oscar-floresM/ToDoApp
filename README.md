# ToDoApp

A simple app that lets you make a list of things to do for the day. 

## Functionality
The app lets you add tasks to a list and keeps track of how many tasks have been completed and how many haven't
Once a task is complete, it can be marked as so by clicking on the checkbox and it will cross and gray out the task.
There are also a delete and edit button that can be used for any already created task.
